it is a easy coding program

question
    Find the leaders in the array(no need to store just print).
    Leader is an element that has no higher element in the right side.

    1) 10, 17, 5, 2, 3, 1
    ans :- 10 is not a leader bcoz 17 is present in its right side
           17 is a leader since no higher than its in the right side
           5 is a leader
           2 is not a leader
           3 is a leader
           1 is a leader

           so the answer should be 17, 5, 3, 1 

    2) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    ans:- 7

    3) 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    ans:- 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

The main task is we should not use i cross j loops(like for loop inside for aka brute force)

See both the approaches in Approach1.java and Approach2.java


Approach1 uses brute force for seeing how it works
Approach2 --> I dont know either it is good one or bad one

Hint :- Dont use Scanner for getting array inputs
use hardcoded array for technical interviews, use Scanner only if interviewer suggests............
