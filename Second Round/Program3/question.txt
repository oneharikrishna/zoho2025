Lets say we have two integers n and s;
we have form n digit number with sum o digits as s;
and the number should not have trailing zeros;
and the number should be highest of all possiblities;

examples:

n = 2, s = 9
answer := 81

other possiblities 90(leading zeros), 18(its okay but not the highest)
