Lets say we have a String containing alphanumeric characters and specail characters;
we have to reverse the alphanumeric characters only;
maintainning the specail characters(including space) in their respective positions;
important note we should not use any built-in methods;

ex := one,two,three
ans := eer,hto,wteno
